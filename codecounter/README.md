Code Counter Project
=============

*C# application*

Counts the lines of code and number of files in a folder, when given an extension. It can also exclude certain files - for example, when I want to check the number of lines in a C# project I often choose \*.cs for the files to read and \*.Designer.cs for the files to exclude, so it will exclude any Visual Studio form designer generated files. One thing I should have done but didn't was have it count the number of lines that are blank.

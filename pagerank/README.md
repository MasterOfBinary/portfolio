PageRank
========

*Matlab application*

Creates a small, random internet and simulates Google's PageRank algorithm on it.
I created this project for my final year math seminar (MATH 401, taught by Prof. Jacek Szmigielski)
because we were studying "Google's PageRank and Beyond" by Amy N. Langville and Carl D. Meyer.

To try it, simply run `main.m`.

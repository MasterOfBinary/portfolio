Vaughn Friesen's Portfolio
=========

Some of the programming work I've done in the past is available here. These are all projects I did by myself, in my spare time.

Each project has a README.md file that describes the project, and most have source code. Binaries for Windows are in a bin directory under the project directory.

I tried to test most of these projects with Visual Studio 2010 and Windows 7, but since most of them are from a long time ago (VS 2005 and Windows XP probably) they might not all work. I'll try to explain any possible issues in the readme, but I can't make any guarantees that they will compile or run.

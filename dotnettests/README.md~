DotNET Tests Project
==============

*C# application - uses WMP, DirectSound libraries*

Several different tests I used to try out features of .NET: graphics and transparency, imaging, assembly (not implemented), and audio. When I tried out the Windows Media Player function in the audio test on my Windows 7 computer, the player didn't show up, although it started playing my sound. The DirectSound function didn't work at all, so I disabled it. I assume it's because of the change in the audio stack in Windows Vista. And the assembly test - I can't remember what it was supposed to do, but it probably had something to do with calling unmanaged DLLs from managed code.

Oh, and to close the program, move your mouse to the top of the window and a menu will appear. Click exit. That was a feature, seriously (remember this is just a test program). It was a stupid feature, but a feature nonetheless.

Bubble Cursor
==============

*Java Swing application*

This was a university project I developed with a classmate, Dustin Walker, at University of Saskatchewan. The project was developed for the "Implementation of Graphical User Interfaces" course (CMPT 381) taught by Prof. Carl Gutwin. It is a variation of the basic mouse cursor, but the difference is that the nearest control is always selected whether the mouse is hovering over it or not.

Its motivation comes from the fact that the time it takes to select a target is based on the target's size and the distance to the target. What the bubble cursor attempts to do is increase the size of the target beyond the bounds of the control.

A YouTube video demonstrating our implementation is available at http://youtu.be/gKbGZBEbtZ4.

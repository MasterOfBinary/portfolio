A C# MP3 tag editor with support for ID3v1 and some v2 tags. I can't remember if the program still had any bugs or if it worked well, so I recommend you don't use it on important files, or make sure you have backups of the files you use. Please. It may work fine or it may not, and I don't have time to test it well. So consider yourself warned.

Church Budget 2007
===========

*C# application (with some C++)*

By far my biggest project. This is the first version of a program I made to manage our church's finances. It isn't working on my Windows 7 computer, so I won't post it here. It's hard on the eyes anyway with the whole program being bright yellow - hey, I was young and inexperienced.

Try the update, Church Budget 2008, instead. It works fine on current versions of Windows.

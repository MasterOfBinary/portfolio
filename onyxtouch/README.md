OnyxTouch Project
===========

*C++ application - uses [GamePlay](http://www.gameplay3d.io/)*

An ocean simulation using the fast Fourier transform.

This project may not be compiling at the moment because it is based on an old version of the GamePlay
library. I'll update it at some point and add VS2015 projects.

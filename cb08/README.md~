Church Budget 2008
==============

*C# application*

This was a pretty major update to the budget program - I added several new features and completely changed the graphics. I also took out a large, likely unnecessary feature - a language parser for reports. I think that's why there was so much less code in this version (18,600 loc vs. 28,000 loc in the previous version).

An earlier version of the program could load C# as well as C++ reports, but the C++ part didn't work very well with Windows x64 so I discontinued it.

Included is the installer, it requires Windows XP SP3 or later because it was built for the .NET Framework 4.0.
